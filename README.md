<span style="color:orange">JUST IN TIME FOR HALLOWEEN!</span> ![Halloween Kitties](docs/assets/evilpumpkin__by_clairebearer.gif)<br>
WitchFall lets you follow the adventures of Addie, the Friendly Witch.  In this Beta version, explore the town of Pumpkin Falls, where it is always October and the air smells like pumpkin spice!  This is a Halloween-themed, friendly game that our team plans to continue developing as part of our portfolio.

Based on the Open-Source framework of [React RPG](https://react-rpg.com/) by [Andrew Steinheiser](https://github.com/ASteinheiser/react-rpg.com), WitchFall is a"Work-In-Progress" RPG made with React and Redux.  The game is a turn-based, dungeon crawler that is slowly being changed to a quest system. Currently you can walk through the village in level 1, battling spiders and checking out the adorable environment.
